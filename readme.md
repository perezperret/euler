# Project Euler Exercises

Some of my solutions to project Euler problems.

## Workflow

- Write down the problem
- Think of possible solutions (maybe do some research)
- Write some `unittest`s for internal methods
- Write some `unittest`s for the main program
- Write some solutions (test are run by running the scripts)

## Notes

- These are somewhat old, but I like to keep them around as a reminder of progress.
- I'm going to try to work on Project Euler a bit every week just for fun so hopefully this repo will start growing.
